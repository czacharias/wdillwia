# WDILLWIA
## What Does It Look Like Where I Am? A simple Nasa satilite imagery viewer.
WDILLWIA gets the latitude and longitude of the city you're currently in, and displays landsat imagery taken in january of the current year from Nasa's [EARTH](https://api.nasa.gov/) api

(images sometimes may seem incomplete or blank, this is unfortunately out of my control, and is a result of nasa's imagery techniques or due to cloud cover on the day the image was taken)
